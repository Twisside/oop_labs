# Laboratory works description

### Lab 1

* Added the Car and Main classes 

### Lab 2

* x Add corresponding Classes
* Create a behavioral something something
* x error handling
* stop crying

I couldn't check if everything works alright  
In some places i nested stuff a bit too much which might be slightly painful to be looked at
, but at least i somewhat figured how these objects work, which i think matters the most

### Lab 3

* x Add the code for checking the status of the directory.
* x Add the additional fancy stuff.

So using some microsoft documentation, I found this neat inbuilt class "FileSystemWatcher" which fit perfectly for the job, except it just didn't work the way i expected it to, and by that i mean it didn't work at all (thanks microsoft)  
I searched for some solutions but no luck so I gave up on the idea to use c# to my advantage and did the job the old fashion way.  
Does it work? Yes, but at what cost?
Why is threading so difficult to implement. Nevermind, every example i found online was overcomplicated for my case.(thanks again microsoft)

Remark: I made the auto check thing in a different color so itis easier to read.

'else' is down. no way im making the submit in time. It's 11.08 PM when i'm finished with lab n2.
